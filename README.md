# Water-Rocket
Analytical model of launching water rocket to a target.

Our actual distance was right on the target distance, 46m, which was 12 meters short of this Matlab prediction. This
makes sense since the initial velocity used in this code was set using the results of our practice run which had a
higher initial pressure and thus a higher initial velocity than our official launch. Also there was wind that day.

We choose 1 radian as initial angle because rocket will go furthest with45 degree when there is no air friction. To
over come the friction, we have to give rocket more vertical velocity. For water, we filled 1/4 space in rocket with
water. This is not too heavy to cause rocket canâ€™t go high enough as well as providing enough thrust for rocket.
